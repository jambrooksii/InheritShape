1. Create a new IntelliJ project named InheritShape, and set up your project as a Git repository. Be sure to commit your code periodically as you work.

        2. Create a class named Shape. Shape should have (2) properties: color (a String) and filled (a boolean). Shape should also have a constructor
        which accepts arguments for both the color & filled properties. Shape should have a method named printShape() which prints out the Shape's
        details (its color and whether or not it is filled).

        3. Create a class named Circle which inherits from Shape. Circle should have (1) property (in addition to the 2 it inherits from Shape):
        radius (a double). Circle should have a constructor which sets all of its properties, using super() to set its inherited properties. Circle
        should also have (2) methods: getArea() which returns the Circle's area, and getPerimeter() which returns the Circle's perimeter. Circle
        should override Shape's printShape() method and should print out a Circle's color, whether or not it is filled, its perimeter and its area.*/
